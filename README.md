# BBDeploy


Collection of scripts for quickly getting a VPS loaded up with some "essential" tools for performing the main recon portions of a Penetration Test or Bug Bounty engagement. 
> The scripts (and tools that are pulled in by the scripts) in this repo have only been tested on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS. If you run issues running them on another Distro you're on your own.
